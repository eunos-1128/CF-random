5JYT preds were generated using the AF-cluster Colab notebook, model 3 (default in notebook): https://colab.research.google.com/github/HWaymentSteele/AF_Cluster/blob/main/AFcluster.ipynb

KaiB-TV4 preds were generated by running ColabFold on AF-cluster seqs; 12 recycles.  Max-seq = 1, max-extra-seq=2
